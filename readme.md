# Donations

For some reason people actually want to donate to me, unfortunately, not much fits my needs, so I've resorted to
crypto (I'm not a cryptobro i promise):

* Monero Wallet (XMR): `43CdVu2YiejjQoBnFM4eK3AhALDcdf1CYgUSPa6FN3t4QY2MNQEHDTU1YBoMPhTNondiJihcoPzoYfJACNMVJV1K6HArQyD`
* Bitcoin (BTC): I _would_ take it, but I'd just convert it to Monero anyway...
